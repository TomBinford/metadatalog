# metadatalog

A naive Datalog evaluator written in [Soufflé](https://souffle-lang.github.io).

This project is tested on Soufflé version 2.4.

To aid in understanding, some helper algorithms used by metadatalog are given in the `samples/` directory.
They all use hardcoded data and output to stdout so you can run them like `$ souffle samples/deduplicate.dl`.
